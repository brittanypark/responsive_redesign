        Usability Problems
      </b>
      <p class="up2">
        1) Categories are sectioned off poorly, i.e. when clicking the "3 Ways To Enjoy Magic Wok"
        it takes the user to the store's locations, instead of clerifying the three steps to ordering
        Magic Wok.
        <br>
        <br>
        2) Redundant use of hot box links dealing with online ordering.
        <br>
        <br>
        3) Too many options – often repetitive – in the drop down Menu.
        <br>
        <br>
        4) Two options in the navigation bar lead to the same webpage.

      <p class="ap2">
        1) Very low contrast between text and background colors.
        <br>
        <br>
        2) Restaurant's name is nowhere in the title.
        <br>
        <br>
        3) Alternative text is likely insufficient or contains extraneous information.
        <br>
        <br>
        4) Adjacent links go to the same URL.
        <br>
        <br>
        5) A noscript element is present.

      <p class="vr1">
        I chose to redesign the home page of Magic Wok for a better, more interactive experience that
        can be accessed on desktop, tablet, and mobile phone devices.

        Some annotations about the design I want to bring up are:
        <br>
        <br>
        1) For the larger containers, flexbox should be utilized. Since the elements I want to include
        only need to be fit into a single row or column, a grid is not necessary.
        <br>
        2) In order to prevent the font and size from decreasing at smaller browser sizes, the containers
        will shrink in column size and increase in row size.
        <br>
        3) All of the text that is clickable will change in appearance when they are hovered over. For example,
        when the navigation bar in the header is hovered over, the text will change from green to bolded orange.
